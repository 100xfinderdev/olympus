# 🚀 Step-by-Step: Add Project to GitHub

## ✅ Step 1: Set Up Git (Do This First!)

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the `olympus` folder and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Replace with YOUR actual name and email!**

## ✅ Step 2: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right)
3. Click **"New repository"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `olympus` (or any name you want)
   - **Description**: "OLYMPUS Divine AI Trading"
   - **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DON'T** check "Add README" or "Add .gitignore" (we already have them)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## ✅ Step 3: Connect and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub shows you commands. **Copy the commands from GitHub** (they look like this):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/olympus.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**OR** if you tell me your GitHub username and repo name, I'll give you the exact commands!
