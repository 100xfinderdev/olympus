# 🖼️ How to Add Your Zeus Image

## Quick Setup:

1. **Save your Zeus image file** (the one you sent)
2. **Name it**: `zeus.jpg`
3. **Put it here**: `olympus/public/gods/zeus.jpg`
4. **Replace** the existing file if there is one
5. **Refresh** your browser

## File Location:
```
olympus/
  └── public/
      └── gods/
          └── zeus.jpg  ← Your image goes here
```

## The image will automatically:
✅ Fit in a perfect circle  
✅ Be centered and cropped  
✅ Have gold border and glow  
✅ Work in all sizes (cards, feed, etc.)

---

**That's it!** Once you save the file, it will appear on your website! 🚀
